# UTC Latex

This repository contains **unofficial** LaTeX templates for the [Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC)](https://www.utc.fr).

I'm not the original author of theses, i've simply adapted for my usage. The original authors are :

- UTC Beamer : milouse, under the [WTFPL license](./licenses/utc-beamer.txt) ([Source](https://github.com/milouse/utclatex))
- UTC Report : Florent Chehab, under the [BSD-2 license]()

The [legal notice](https://www.utc.fr/mentions-legales.html) of the UTC website stipulates :

> Any use whatsoever of the brand names and logos on this site is prohibited without the authorization of the Université de Technologie de Compiègne.

It is therefore advisable to use them within a framework satisfying this rule :)

I'm not a (yet) LaTeX master so feel free to open issues if you see something absolutely stupid and better, feel free to propose a pull request :)
