# UTC Latex

This repository contains **unofficial** LaTeX templates for the [Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC)](https://www.utc.fr).

I'm not the original author of theses, i've simply adapted for my usage. The original authors are :

- UTC Beamer : milouse, under the [WTFPL license](./licenses/utc-beamer.txt) ([Source](https://github.com/milouse/utclatex))

The logos  are the exclusive property of the [UTC](https://www.utc.fr). 

I'm not a (yet) LaTeX master so feel free to open issues if you see something absolutely stupid and better, feel free to propose a pull request :)
